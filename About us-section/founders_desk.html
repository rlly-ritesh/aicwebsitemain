                    <p>I have always believed that education is not just about imparting knowledge but about empowering people to change the world around them. Today, more than ever, our country needs innovators and entrepreneurs who can solve real problems and create opportunities for many.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Atal Incubation Centre - SOA Foundation reflects our genuine commitment to nurturing such talent. We want to see our students, faculty, and young innovators take bold steps, test their ideas, and grow them into solutions that can truly make a difference. With over 20,000 students and a large, dedicated faculty, we have the strength and the responsibility to build a thriving ecosystem for startups and innovation.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am happy to see that the AIC-SOA Foundation has already become a platform where healthtech pioneers, agritech innovators, AI enthusiasts, and social impact entrepreneurs can find support and mentorship. Through this Startup Incubation Policy, we are laying down a clear, open, and inclusive framework to help these early-stage ventures flourish.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes me particularly proud is that this initiative is aligned with the vision of NITI Aayog's Atal Innovation Mission. It is encouraging to see so many women founders and young students stepping forward—showing that entrepreneurship can and should be inclusive and diverse.</p>
                    
                    <p>I sincerely invite all our stakeholders—students, faculty members, mentors, industry partners, and government collaborators—to join hands with us. Let's create an environment where our future changemakers feel supported and inspired to turn their ideas into reality.</p>
                    
                    <p>Together, let’s build, innovate, and make a positive impact on society.</p>
